# Recursion Exercises

These exercises include finding fibonacci sequence and merge sort.

## Fibonacci Sequence
- First method is implemented with iteration which will output an sequence array of containing given number of elements
- Second method uses recursion. Outputs a hash contaning numbers of nth elements.

## Merge Sort

- Resembles to Top-Down implementation of Merge Sort from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort
